  abstract = {The Deepfake algorithm allows its user to create fake images, audios, videos that gives very real impression but is fake in real sense. This degree of technology is achieved due to advancements in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networking that is a combination of algorithms like generative adversarial network (GAN), autoencoders etc. Any technology has its positive and negative repercussions. Deep fake can come in use for helping people who have lost their speech to give them new improved voice, commercially deepfake can be used in improving animation or movie quality putting in creative imagination to work as well is therapeutic to people who have lost their dear once.  Negative aspects of deep fake include creating fake images, videos, audios that look very real can cause threats to an individual's privacy, organizations, democracy, and even national security.  This review paper presents history on how deep fake emerged, will comprehend on how it works including various algorithms, major research works done on understanding deep fakes in the literature and most importantly discuss recent advancements in detection of deep fake methods and its robust preventive measures.},

  abstract = {The twenty-first century has seen technology become an integral part of human survival. Living standards have been affected as the technology continues to advance. Deep fake is a deep learning-powered application that recently appeared on the market. It allows to make fake images and videos that people cannot discern from the real ones and is a recent technique that allows swapping two identities within a single video. A wide range of factors, including communities, organizations, security, religions, democratic processes as well as personal lives, are being impacted by deep fakes. In the case of images and videos being presented to an organization as evidence, if the images or videos are altered, the entire truth will be transformed into a lie. It is inevitable that with every new and beneficial technology, some of its adverse effects will follow, causing world problems. There have been several instances in which deep fakes have alarmed the entire network. During the last few years, the number of altered images and videos has grown exponentially, posing a threat to society. Additionally, this paper explores where deep fakes are used, the impacts made by them, as well as the challenges and difficulties associated with deep fakes in this rapidly developing society.},
